# Interactive Web Map with Leaflet.js and Chart.js  

## Description  
This project demonstrates the use of web mapping technologies for visualizing healthcare facilities. Built with **Leaflet.js**, **MarkerCluster**, and **Chart.js**, it provides an interactive platform where users can:  
- View a geographic distribution of health-related points of interest.  
- Explore clusters of markers and polygons representing healthcare facilities.  
- Click on map polygons to see detailed statistics displayed dynamically in a bar chart.  

## Features  
- **Dynamic Map**: Interactive map with zoom and pan features.  
- **Clustered Markers**: Better visualization for densely packed points.  
- **GeoJSON Data Integration**: Predefined polygons and points.  
- **Dynamic Charting**: A bar chart updates based on user interaction.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Leaflet.js**: For map rendering and interactivity.  
- **Chart.js**: For creating responsive bar charts.  
- **MarkerCluster**: To manage clustered points.  

##In order to see the plots, it is necessary to click on the blue polygons.
